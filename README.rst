requirements files complete and up-to-date.

Background
----------

Every non-library Python project should have a ``requirements.txt`` file
which lists required Python packages for the project, i.e. its
dependencies.  It would be easy to just list the dependencies with their
minimum and maximum versions in there, but that's not a good practice.
If versions of the dependencies are not pinned to exact versions, it's
uncertain which version of the packages get installed.  Even pinning the
direct dependencies is not enough, since project dependencies might have
their own dependencies (project's indirect dependencies) and those
should be pinned too.  That's where Prequ comes in: it makes it easy to
generate the list of those pinned direct and indirect dependencies from
the non-pinned requirements.

There is also `a good article by Vincent Driessen
<http://nvie.com/posts/pin-your-packages>`_ which explains it more
thoroughly why you should pin your packages.

Prequ is a fork of pip-tools_ by Vincent Driessen.  Pip-tools was a fine
project, but I wanted to add couple new features and make some changes
to existing workflows.  There were also couple bugs that I needed to be
fixed sooner than later.  Most of those bugs were already fixed in
GitHub pull requests, but weren't merged to pip-tools.  That's why I
decided to create my own fork.

Installation
------------

::

   $ pip install --upgrade pip  # Prequ needs pip==8.0 or higher
   $ pip install prequ


Example usage for ``prequ update``
----------------------------------

Suppose you have a Flask project, and want to pin it for production.
Write the following content to so-called *pre-requirements* file, named
``requirements.pre``:

.. code:: yaml

   requirements:
     base: |
       Flask

Now, run ``prequ update``::

   $ prequ update
   *** Compiling requirements.txt

And it will produce your ``requirements.txt``, with all the Flask
dependencies and all underlying dependencies pinned.  Put this file
under version control as well.  Generated file will look like this::

   # This file is autogenerated by Prequ.  To update, run:
   #
   #   prequ update
   #
   flask==0.10.1
   itsdangerous==0.24
   jinja2==2.7.3
   markupsafe==0.23
   werkzeug==0.10.4

To add/remove packages, add/remove them to/from ``requirements.pre`` and
re-run ``prequ update``.  To upgrade all packages, remove the generated
``requirements.txt`` and run ``prequ update`` again.


Example usage for ``prequ sync``
--------------------------------

Now that you have a ``requirements.txt``, you can use ``prequ sync``
to update your virtual env to reflect exactly what's in there.  Note:
this will install/upgrade/uninstall everything necessary to match the
``requirements.txt`` contents.

::

   $ prequ sync
   Uninstalling flake8-2.4.1:
     Successfully uninstalled flake8-2.4.1
   Collecting click==4.1
     Downloading click-4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (62kB)
     ...
     Found existing installation: click 4.0
       Uninstalling click-4.0:
         Successfully uninstalled click-4.0
   Successfully installed click-4.1

To sync multiple ``*.txt`` dependency lists, just pass them in via
command line arguments e.g.::

   $ prequ sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt

Passing in empty arguments would cause it to default to
``requirements.txt``.


More detailed example of ``requirements.pre``
---------------------------------------------

Prequ supports defining couple options for the requirement compiling and
automatically building wheels from pip URLs.  Here is a more detailed
example of a pre-requirement file that demonstrates those features:

.. code:: yaml

   # Prequ pre-requirements file

   options:
     annotate: yes
     generate_hashes: no
     header: yes
     extra_index_urls:
       - https://shuup.github.io/pypi/simple/
     wheel_dir: wheels
     wheel_sources:
       github_shuup: git+ssh://git@github.com/shuup/{pkg}@v{ver}

   requirements:

     base: |
       django~=1.9.5
       shuup~=0.5.0
       shuup-stripe~=0.4.2 (wheel from github_shuup)

     dev: |
       flake8
       pep8-naming

Now running ``prequ update`` will first build a wheel package for
shuup-stripe and then it will generate two files, ``requirements.txt``
and ``requirements-dev.txt``::

   $ prequ update
   *** Building wheel for shuup-stripe 0.4.2 from
           git+ssh://git@github.com/shuup/shuup-stripe@v0.4.2
   Collecting git+ssh://git@github.com/shuup/shuup-stripe@v0.4.2
   ...
   Successfully built shuup-stripe
   Cleaning up...
   Removing source in /tmp/pip-b5rf3ioq-build
   *** Built: wheels/shuup_stripe-0.4.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
   *** Compiling requirements.txt
   *** Compiling requirements-dev.txt

The generated files will have extra-index-url option as specified and
and find-links for the wheels directory::

   $ cat requirements.txt
   # This file is autogenerated by Prequ.  To update, run:
   #
   #   prequ update
   #
   --extra-index-url https://shuup.github.io/pypi/simple/
   --find-links wheels

   Babel==2.3.4              # via shuup
   django-bootstrap3==6.2.2  # via shuup
   ...
   $ cat requirements-dev.txt
   # This file is autogenerated by Prequ.  To update, run:
   #
   #   prequ update
   #
   --extra-index-url https://shuup.github.io/pypi/simple/
   --find-links wheels

   flake8==3.3.0
   mccabe==0.6.1             # via flake8
   pep8-naming==0.4.1
   pycodestyle==2.3.1        # via flake8
   pyflakes==1.5.0           # via flake8
